# FinOps Toolkit

A comprehensive portfolio of scripts and tools for Financial Operations (FinOps) across cloud platforms. This toolkit helps organizations optimize cloud spending, detect cost anomalies, and maintain financial governance.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Build a modular collection of FinOps tools that enable:
- **Cost Visibility**: Understand where money is being spent
- **Cost Optimization**: Identify opportunities to reduce waste
- **Cost Governance**: Enforce policies and budgets
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Work across Azure, AWS, GCP, and other providers

## 📦 Modules

### Azure Cost Analysis
**Location:** [`azure/cost_analysis/`](azure/cost_analysis/)

Tools for analyzing Azure costs with parameterized comparisons and anomaly detection.

**Features:**
- Accumulated cost comparisons between any two time periods
- Resource-level cost analysis with top increases
- Automatic anomaly detection (new costs, removed costs, significant changes)
- Clean, readable reports with ANSI-stripped output
- Multi-subscription support with friendly naming

**Scripts:**
- [`diff_accumulated/accumulatedCost.ps1`](azure/cost_analysis/diff_accumulated/accumulatedCost.ps1) - Compare total costs
- [`diff_resource/diff_costByResource.ps1`](azure/cost_analysis/diff_resource/diff_costByResource.ps1) - Resource-level analysis

[📖 Full Documentation](azure/cost_analysis/README.md)

### Future Modules (Planned)

- **AWS Cost Analysis** - Similar tools for AWS Cost Explorer
- **GCP Cost Analysis** - Google Cloud cost management tools
- **Budget Management** - Cross-cloud budget tracking and alerting
- **Tagging Governance** - Enforce and audit resource tagging
- **Reservation Optimization** - Analyze and recommend reserved instances
- **Waste Detection** - Identify unused or underutilized resources

## 🚀 Getting Started
